# sirfont
Electron React font playground.

A simple playground project meant to:

- Satisfy my son's desire to play with every font he could find online without installing it on my machine.
- Explore Electron/React
- Show my son the basics of web development

## To run

- Place all the horrible custom fonts you can find in `~/.sirFont/fonts`
- Run `npm run watch` in the code folder
- Hit F5 in VSCode
